## Keyboard Shortcuts

I use mac terminal almost daily, but for some reason, these keyboard shortcuts had evaded me
all these years...

- Go to beginning of a line: ``` cmd + a ```
- Go to end of a line: ``` cmd + e ```
- Move left word-by-word: ``` alt + <- ```
- Move right word-by-word: ``` alt + -> ```

## Terminal Style

After using my personal terminal style for so long, it has become a necessity.
To be filled in later...

1. color scheme + window transparency
2. prompt format
3. directory highlight
4. fortune + cowsay
5. shortcuts + aliases
